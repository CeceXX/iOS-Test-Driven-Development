# iOS Test Driven Development

Example project from a iOS TDD workshop.

## Introduction

* Use unit tests to manage the complexity of larger iOS projects.
* Tests are a safety net against the introduction of bugs.
* Applications that are written using TDD only contain code that is necessary to solve the problem.
* It is very difficult and time consuming to test all the features of big apps by hand (computers are much faster than humans).

## Your first unit test
* Unit tests act like a robot which tests the code for you.
* They execute the code without navigating to the screen with the feature to test.
* You write tests with different input data and let the computer test your code.
